# 4.2in E-Paper Spotify Display 

I designed a lasercut acrylic frame and 3D-Printed enclosure for the E-Paper display and RaspberryPiZero. The software is forked from [alexthescott/ePaper-Spotify-Clock](https://github.com/alexthescott/ePaper-Spotify-Clock) and uses Python3 to display two user's recent Spotify history, weather for two cities (local and away), and the current time.
